# Future Enhancements

This tutorial covers the basic implementation of a local AI client using Next.js and Ollama. However, there are several important features that could be added to make the application more complete:

## Missing Features

1. **Fetching Ollama Models**

   - Adding ability to list all available models from Ollama
   - Implementing model download functionality directly from the UI
   - Displaying model details (size, parameters, capabilities)

2. **Persisting the Model in Conversations**

   - Currently, the model selection isn't saved with each conversation
   - Need to implement model metadata storage for each chat
   - Allow different conversations to use different models

3. **Deleting Conversations**
   - No functionality to remove old or unwanted conversations
   - Need to implement deletion with confirmation
   - Option for bulk deletion of multiple conversations

## Implementation Considerations

These features would require:

- Additional database schema modifications
- API endpoints for Ollama model management
- UI components for model selection and conversation management
- Proper error handling for network/availability issues

Adding these features would significantly enhance the usability and completeness of the application.
